Update_File_Python2
Updating a File through a Python Algorithm This Python script automates the process of managing an allow list of IP addresses stored in a file, allow_list.txt. The algorithm reads the file's contents, processes it into a manageable list format, and removes specific IP addresses based on a predefined remove_list. Using efficient methods such as .split() and .remove(), the script ensures that only valid IPs remain in the allow list. After modifications, the updated list is converted back to a string with .join() and written to the original file, ensuring the allow list reflects the most current access permissions. The use of with statements for file operations guarantees proper resource management and file closure. This script demonstrates a practical application of Python for automating file updates while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.
